# weChat_JumperGame


This is a jupyter python script that can automatically play the WeChat Jumper (跳一跳) game. It only works with Android Phone now (require developer option->ADB USB debug).

All the coordinate/sizes are based on 1920x1080 resolution phone. If your phone is under a different resolution, you will have to adjust the parameters by yourself.

You can run the script auto_jump.ipynb in jupyter notebook, or run auto_jump.py in python. You will need opencv and numpy in order to run the scripts.
